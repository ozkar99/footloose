# footloose

footloose is a (windows only) small utiliy that transforms midi CC messages into windows inputs (keystrokes, mouse clicks, and mouse movements, etc...),

it is configured by editing its source code, its pre-configured with a simple `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` example, for CC `53` and `52` respectively.

footloose does not care for program changes or the values of the control changes messages, although this could easily be extended for that use-case.
